                <p>
                    Life has so many things to offer. Learning everything in life is an impossible feat 
                    but many people throughout history have seemingly made it their life's mission to do 
                    just that. Curiosity and creativity, and exploration should be at the root of learning 
                    and one group from the past that defines this for me are alchemists. The original 
                    chemists from which all of the wonderful technology we have today was born. Silicon, 
                    Copper, Plastic, Glass all came from a desire to explore minerals and the wonderful 
                    world that God has given to us. Although I don't know much about chemistry I admmire 
                    all of the things it has given us. This website is name Andymium as a combination of my 
                    name "Andre", and Didymium a chemical compound that was created by combining two elements 
                    and is used in saftey glasses so that people can protect their eyes while glassblowing. 
                    This chemical like so many others has given back to the same industry that allowed it to 
                    be produced. With this repository of knowledge I hope to do the same for anyone who finds 
                    my blog.
